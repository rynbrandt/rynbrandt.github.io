I am a professor of political science at Collin College and a PhD student in the Public Policy and Political Economy program at UT Dallas.

I am also currently raising funds for the American Cancer Society by running in a Spartan Race on October 22, 2023. Contribute in memory of someone you've lost to cancer. Contribute in celebration of someone who has survived it. Contribute so that fewer people have to fight this fight and so those who do have better support and a better chance than they have now. Any amount big or small is appreciated and helpful! Donations to this [page](https://acs.fundraise.spartan.com/page/RyanRynbrandt) are secure, go 100% to the American Cancer Society, and are tax deductible.
