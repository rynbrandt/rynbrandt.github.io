    "text": "Analyze Survey:\n\n\nHow is the survey structured? The survey begins with an introduction that is fairly incomplete. It should introduce the project more thoroughly but without biasing answers to the questions that follow. The intro is followed by 18 questions. The first 13 questions ask about the respondent’s preferences and behaviors regarding movies and software. The remaining questions ask about the respondent’s characteristics in terms of location, demographics, marital status and income.\nWhat is the questionnaire composed of? The questionnaire is composed of an introduction, a panel of statements to which the respondent can express degrees of agreement, numerous multiple choice questions, multiple yes/no questions, two questions asking the respondent to choose an expected cost, two questions that require a choice from a drop-down menu\nHow are the questions ordered? The survey begins with an introduction, which is followed by 18 questions. The first 13 questions ask about the respondent’s preferences and behaviors regarding movies and software. The remaining questions ask about the respondent’s characteristics in terms of location, demographics, marital status and income.\nCheck out the Import from Library option to consider importing:\n\n\nUS race question (under Demographics→US demographics) - complete\nUS Zip code question - complete\n\n\nChange the Look and Feel (paint roller icon on left menu) to select UT Dallas theme – complete\nUse Skip Logic in Q4, if answer is NO, skip to the question Q7 “Do you feel comfortable purchasing software over the internet? – complete\nApply Validation to every question (Force Response) – complete\nInsert Page break to save respondents from scrolling down the screen – complete\nWhat can be done to improve respondent’s experience? A better introduction would help.It should introduce the project thoroughly but without biasing the answers to come. But I think overall the survey does a good job being concise, providing understandable response options, using a variety of questions types, thanking the respondent before and after the survey, etc.\n\nAccording to the ExpertReview, a few things could be done to improve the respondent’s experience. These include optimizing the questions for mobile, completing translations for each question, making the questions accessible and WCAG 2.0AA compliant, and enabling checking for bots.\nThe completed assignment can be found at https://utdallas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5ncdyREPX40LZWe\nFurther assignment: Importing a survey from Qualtrics library 1.Create a survey using your library, then choose Qualtrics library – complete\n\nChoose All Projects and Programs → Search for “Diversity and Inclusiveness Survey” – complete\nImport a block with income and education questions. – complete\nWhat is the difference between this block and previous Instrument? This block has a more detailed income question. It asks about total household income before taxes, rather than just about household income. It has six income categories rather than four and it includes a “prefer not to say” option. The previous instrument did not include a question about education.\n\nThe completed assignment can be found at https://utdallas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eJMcPV4uwiCtWho"

Determine what column is needed for a panel. Be sure to include the email addresses. Alternatively send the link to panelists to pilot test the Movie Rental survey. – complete. I sent the survey to my panel and have already had completed surveys.\n\n\n\n\nQualtricsPic\n\n\nB. Google Trends data a. Use Google Trends website to: i. Search Trump, Biden and Election - complete ii. Download the data - complete 1. Analyze the data: According to Google Trends, the data indicates the following: “Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term.” a. Dates – Google Trends provided data from 9/17/23, 11:16:00-05.00 through 9/18/23, 11:08:00-05:00 b. Intervals – Google Trends provided data in intervals of 8 minutes\n\n\n\nGoogle Trends Data\n\n\n\nUse gtrendsR package to do a. (use gtrendsR01.R program)\nSearch Trump, Biden and Election - complete\n\n\nDownload the data - complete 1. Analyze the data: I was able to run the script, but spent a long time looking for a way to actually look at the data in R Studio in a way that would allow me to compare it to the data I downloaded from Google Trends and cannot seem to figure it out. When I try to view it, I get this:\n\nDates – clearly R produced a longer timeline, going all the way back to before 2005.\nIntervals – It is not clear to me what the intervals are since I can’t seem to find a way to view the actual data.\n\n\n\n\n\ngtrendsRpic\n\n\n\nWhat are the differences between the two methods? Using Google Trends directly doesn’t require coding knowledge and is quite user-friendly. For a while I didn’t know there was a script provided and struggled to find out how to write the code myself. Yet R has its advantages. Using R would allow automation of the process, allowing small changes to the script to make it simple to repeatedly retrieve and analyze the data in different ways. This would allow easier reproduction and customization of the analysis in the future.\n\n\n\n\nMy screenshot"

The data source is a collection of Twitter posts related to the summit that took place in November 2021.The dataset contains a total of 14520 observations of 90 variables. Each record represents an individual tweet posted on Twitter.\nIn the analysis of the Biden-Xi summit data, tokenization prepared the text data for further analysis, which included text extraction, tokenization and cleaning of special characters and punctuation. Next, a document-feature matrix (DFM) was created.Each cell contains the frequency of a particular word in a specific tweet. Latent Semantic Analysis was then applied to the DFM.\nThe top hashtags found were “#china”, “#biden”, “#xijinping”, “#joebiden”, “#america”, “#americans” , “#coronavirus”, “#fentanyl”, “#xi”, and “#uyghurgenocide”. The prevalence of China-centric hashtags like #china, #xijinping, and #xi indicates a focus on China’s role and leadership in the summit. The prevalence of hashtags like #biden, #joebiden and #america highlight the role of President Biden and the American government in the summit. The #coronavirus hashtag indicates the continuing importance of the pandemic.The fact that the pandemic began in China is likely a reason, though cooperation on pandemic response may have been indicated. The hashtag #fentanyl suggests that discussions about the opioid crisis, which has touched both countries, and the role of illicit fentanyl production particularly in China, were topics of concern.The presence of #uyghurgenocide highlights discussions related to human rights abuses in China. Overall, the top hashtags reflect discussions about diplomacy, leadership, global challenges, and significant geopolitical and human rights issues, offering an overview of public sentiment and concern regarding the summit.\n\nThe top user mentions were “@potus”, “@joebiden”, @politico“,”@eneskanter“,”@jendeben“,”@nwadhams” , “@nba”, “@washwizards”, “@pelicansnba”, “@capitalonearena”, “@kevinliptakcnn”,“@foxbusiness”, “@morningsmaria” , “@scmpnews”, “@uyghur_american”, “@nytimes”, “@petermartin_pcm”, “@nahaltoosi”, “@phelimkine”, and “@kaylatausche”. The presence of “@potus” and “@joebiden” suggests that official accounts related to the U.S. government, including President Joe Biden’s account, were active on Twitter trying to shape the narrative about the summit. Strangely, they don’t appear on the plot produced by R. Several media-related accounts, such as “@politico,” “@nytimes,” and “@foxbusiness,” indicate the influential role of media outlets and journalists in reporting on and analyzing the summit’s developments. However, the hashtags related to the NBA are a bit puzzling, and I don’t recognize the others.\n\nb.US presidential inaugural speeches\nHere we perform text analysis on a subset of inaugural speeches the corpus where the “Year” is after 1949, focusing on three keywords (“american,” “people,” and “communist”). The code generates x-ray plots to visualize the context in which these keywords appear in the speeches and applies color coding to distinguish between the keywords in the plots. I ran the code that was given and it didn’t work, so I asked ChatGPT for a fix based on the error message received. This time it worked, but it still will not include “communist” in the plot because it says that there are 0 observations.\nFor the word “American” there are 74 observations of 7 variables and for the word “people” there are 156 observations of 7 variables. For “communist” there are 0 observations of 7 variables.\n\ni.Any similarities and differences over time and among presidents?\nThere seems to be a cycling in the usage of “American” over time. That cycle seems to have at least a loose tie to the party of the president, with Republican presidents using the word less than Democratic presidents. There is less of a distinct patter in the usage of “People”.\n4.What is Wordfish? (Do research on quanteda website)\nAccording to the Quanteda website, “Wordfish is a Poisson scaling model that estimates one-dimension document positions using maximum likelihood.” It estimates the positions of documents along a single dimension based on observed word frequencies in the documents.Wordfish can be used to visualize textual data to highlight latent relationships between documents."
