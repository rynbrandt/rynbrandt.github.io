    "text": "Analyze Survey:\n\n\nHow is the survey structured? The survey begins with an introduction that is fairly incomplete. It should introduce the project more thoroughly but without biasing answers to the questions that follow. The intro is followed by 18 questions. The first 13 questions ask about the respondent’s preferences and behaviors regarding movies and software. The remaining questions ask about the respondent’s characteristics in terms of location, demographics, marital status and income.\nWhat is the questionnaire composed of? The questionnaire is composed of an introduction, a panel of statements to which the respondent can express degrees of agreement, numerous multiple choice questions, multiple yes/no questions, two questions asking the respondent to choose an expected cost, two questions that require a choice from a drop-down menu\nHow are the questions ordered? The survey begins with an introduction, which is followed by 18 questions. The first 13 questions ask about the respondent’s preferences and behaviors regarding movies and software. The remaining questions ask about the respondent’s characteristics in terms of location, demographics, marital status and income.\nCheck out the Import from Library option to consider importing:\n\n\nUS race question (under Demographics→US demographics) - complete\nUS Zip code question - complete\n\n\nChange the Look and Feel (paint roller icon on left menu) to select UT Dallas theme – complete\nUse Skip Logic in Q4, if answer is NO, skip to the question Q7 “Do you feel comfortable purchasing software over the internet? – complete\nApply Validation to every question (Force Response) – complete\nInsert Page break to save respondents from scrolling down the screen – complete\nWhat can be done to improve respondent’s experience? A better introduction would help.It should introduce the project thoroughly but without biasing the answers to come. But I think overall the survey does a good job being concise, providing understandable response options, using a variety of questions types, thanking the respondent before and after the survey, etc.\n\nAccording to the ExpertReview, a few things could be done to improve the respondent’s experience. These include optimizing the questions for mobile, completing translations for each question, making the questions accessible and WCAG 2.0AA compliant, and enabling checking for bots.\nThe completed assignment can be found at https://utdallas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5ncdyREPX40LZWe\nFurther assignment: Importing a survey from Qualtrics library 1.Create a survey using your library, then choose Qualtrics library – complete\n\nChoose All Projects and Programs → Search for “Diversity and Inclusiveness Survey” – complete\nImport a block with income and education questions. – complete\nWhat is the difference between this block and previous Instrument? This block has a more detailed income question. It asks about total household income before taxes, rather than just about household income. It has six income categories rather than four and it includes a “prefer not to say” option. The previous instrument did not include a question about education.\n\nThe completed assignment can be found at https://utdallas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eJMcPV4uwiCtWho"

I sent the survey to my panel and have already had completed surveys.\n\n\n\n\nQualtricsPic\n\n\nB. Google Trends data a. Use Google Trends website to: i. Search Trump, Biden and Election - complete ii. Download the data - complete 1. Analyze the data: According to Google Trends, the data indicates the following: “Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term.” a. Dates – Google Trends provided data from 9/17/23, 11:16:00-05.00 through 9/18/23, 11:08:00-05:00 b. Intervals – Google Trends provided data in intervals of 8 minutes\n\n\n\nGoogle Trends Data\n\n\n\nUse gtrendsR package to do a.

Analyze the data: I was able to run the script, but spent a long time looking for a way to actually look at the data in R Studio in a way that would allow me to compare it to the data I downloaded from Google Trends and cannot seem to figure it out. When I try to view it, I get this:\n\nDates – clearly R produced a longer timeline, going all the way back to before 2005.\nIntervals – It is not clear to me what the intervals are since I can’t seem to find a way to view the actual data.\n\n\n\n\n\ngtrendsRpic\n\n\n\nWhat are the differences between the two methods? Using Google Trends directly doesn’t require coding knowledge and is quite user-friendly. For a while I didn’t know there was a script provided and struggled to find out how to write the code myself. Yet R has its advantages. Using R would allow automation of the process, allowing small changes to the script to make it simple to repeatedly retrieve and analyze the data in different ways. This would allow easier reproduction and customization of the analysis in the future.\n\n\n\n\nMy screenshot"
