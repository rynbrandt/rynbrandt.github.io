## Read **A Guide to Working with US Census Data in R**

## Get an API key from Census using this website (http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)

## Run spatialdata01.R and spatialdata02.R. 

The script "spatialdata01.R" fetches Census data related to the median age for each state in 2019 and creates a map using the ggplot2 package to represent the data. The resulting map (below) shows how median age varies across different states in the U.S.

The script "spatialdata2" collects and maps Census data related to income in Texas, with a specific focus on Dallas County, for the year 2020. The color intensity on the maps represents variations in income levels. The first map provides a visual representation of income distribution across different geographic areas within Texas. The second map is an interactive map that focuses on income distribution in Dallas county.

I was unable to embed the interactive map in this page, so I took a screenshot instead

## Compare different years of data (e.g. 2010 and 2020)

I begin by comparing the median age by state maps. First I created the following map for 2009 data:

Then I created the following map for 2021 data. The comparison reveals a decrease in the median age in much of the central United States and some other states like Pennsylvania.

Next I compared the Texas income data for two different years. First I created the following map for 2011.

Then I created the map for 2021. The comparison shows an increase in median household incomes in a variety of counties in West Texas and the Panhandle, but also in a variety of areas outside the cities of the Texas Triangle.

To compare the change in Dallas County over time, I first created the map for 2011

![Dallas Income Distribution 2011](EPPS6302%20Asgmt8%20Rplot05%202011%20dallas%20income%20estimate.png){fig-align="center"}

Then I created the map for 2021. The comparison shows a striking increase in median income particular in north central Dallas County.
